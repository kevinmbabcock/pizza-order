## Description

This application is a pizza order form. It has an option for the user to select a delivery or not, size, curst, sauce, crust, flavor, and both meat and veggie toppings. After a pizza is complete, the user submits the form and the pizza is displayed, along with an address form if delivery is requested. The user may see the details of each pizza by clicking on the pizza. The bottom on the page shows the total cost of all pizzas for the order and delivery details if applicable.
